    <h2>MY ALT SCHOOL ID:</h2>
     <p>ALT/SOE/025/3646</p>

 <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
 <p> My name is Joshua Bolade, a technology professional with a <br>
    strong academic foundation in Computer Science (BSc) and Software Project Management (MSc).<br>
    I'Ve gained professional experience by working as an I.T Support <br>
    Analyst and Data Management Analyst, gaining hands-on experience <br>in systems support and data governance.
    Beyond his professional pursuits, I am a strong advocate for family<br> values and mentorship,
with a long-term goal of fostering a culture of responsible, value-driven<br> leadership in technology and society.</p>


<h2>Why I joined the Program</h2>

<p>I joined the Cloud Engineering program because I recognized that cloud computing<br>
    is at the heart of today’s digital transformation—and will continue to shape the future of technology.<br>

This program offers exactly what I need: a strong foundation in designing scalable <br>
cloud infrastructure, hands-on experience with tools like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes,<br>
 and most importantly, a focus on real-world problem-solving. It also aligns perfectly with<br>
 my long-term goal of becoming a cloud security specialist and leader in cloud architecture.</p>
 
<h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
<p>My primary goal in pursuing a program in Cloud Engineering at the School of Engineering<br>
is to deepen my technical expertise in designing, securing, and managing scalable cloud infrastructure.<br>
With a strong foundation in computer science and professional experience in IT support and data management,<br>
I am now committed to becoming a highly skilled cloud security specialist and cloud architect.<br>
This program is a strategic next step toward fulfilling that mission.

Specifically, I aim to:<br>

Master advanced cloud platforms and tools, along with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.<br>

Develop cloud-native architecture skills, enabling me to design resilient,
high-performance systems using microservices and serverless technologies.</p>
